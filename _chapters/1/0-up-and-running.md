    title: "Lab 1: Sinatra Todo"
    summary: We will be rewriting our static todo HTML page as a Sinatra application. Our app will read in a list of todo items from a text file and then render them as HTML when it recieves a GET request from the browser.
    requirements: 
        - Your app should be able to read in a list of todo items with optional due dates from a text file
        - It should respond to GET requests at the site root with an HTML representation of your todo list that passes <a href="http://validator.w3.org">the w3c validator</a>.
        - It should have a form for submitting new todo items to the server via a POST request.
    due: before next week's class

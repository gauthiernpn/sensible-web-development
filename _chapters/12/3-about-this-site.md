todo - update this

If you're curious about the technology behind this website, it's built from a collection of [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) files into static HTML with a tool called [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), and uses [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) and [SASS](http://sass-lang.com) for styling. The header background images are generated client-side with a JavaScript library that I wrote called [Trianglify](http://qrohlf.com/trianglify/). All of the source is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/qrohlf/sensible-web-development), and you can submit corrections and suggestions using the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/qrohlf/sensible-web-development).

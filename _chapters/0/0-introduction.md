# Introduction

## Wecolme to the lab section of CS393.
This is the online text for this course. It contains background information about each lesson as well as homework assignments, links to external resources, and troubleshooting tips. If you're curious about how it was made, the site is built by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) â€“ a static site generator written in Ruby, and uses [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) and [SASS](http://sass-lang.com) for styling. The header background images are procedurally generated using a tool that I wrote called [Trianglify](http://qrohlf.com/trianglify/).

The format for this class is a little bit unique. On Tuesdays, Jens will be lecturing on some of the fundamentals of computer networking, Internet protocols, and other relevant topics. On Thursdays, I'll running a 30-60 minute workshop at the start of class, then helping you get started with the assignment for the week.

# Assignments
All of the course assignments are already posted online, in the introduction to that week's chapter. You will be turning in lab assignments via [GitHub](https://github.com). There is no penalty for late work, but because each lab builds off the previous week's code it's going to be a lot of work to catch up if you fall behind. Finishing the labs on time will ensure that you get the most out of this class, and it will also ensure that I have time to give you feedback before the next week's assignment is due.

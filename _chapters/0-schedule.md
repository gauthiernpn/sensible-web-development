# Schedule
This is a general overview for the whole course. If you have a question about a specific week or lab, you can find more info in the introduction to the corresponding chapter. **Each lab is assigned in class and is due at the beginning of class the following week (i.e we will talk about Lab 0 in class on Week 0, and it will be due before class on Week 1)**.

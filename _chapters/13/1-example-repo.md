One of the resources available to you for this course is a GitHub repo containing working solutions to all the labs. It should be helpful for when you get stuck or can't quite remember how to do something. Just keep in mind that you'll probably get a lot more out of the labs if you try to come up with your own solutions first before looking at the reference code.

The repo is located at https://github.com/qrohlf/webdev.

To check it out, simply clone it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/qrohlf/webdev.git
```

And then to view the solution for a particular lab, just check out the relevant release using git tags. (You can view a list of the releases on [GitHub](https://github.com/qrohlf/webdev/releases))

```bash
git checkout v0.1.0 # check out the example for lab 1
```

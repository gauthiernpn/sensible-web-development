# Help! I don't quite understand...


## ...Ruby

If you're having trouble with Ruby, you might find the official Ruby [quickstart](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/quickstart/) tutorial helpful. It walks you through basic syntax, methods, string interpolation, classes, looping, blocks, and duck typing.

You can also try going through the [Try Ruby](http://tryruby.org) interactive tutorial again, this time making sure you understand everything that you're doing before moving on.

## ...Git

If the [Try Git](http://try.github.io) tutorial didn't make sense to you, the Git Basics [Video Series](http://git-scm.com/videos) might be a good place to go for some additional help.

## ...Sinatra

Read the [Readme](http://www.sinatrarb.com/intro.html).

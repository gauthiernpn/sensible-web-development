  By popular demand, this Thursday will be extended office hours. If you are behind (you don't have Lab 2 finished), please come to class with one or two **specific** things that you want help with. Please note that there is still a lab assigned this week - I want you to get used to continuously iterating on and improving your app in preperation for the project portion of this class.
